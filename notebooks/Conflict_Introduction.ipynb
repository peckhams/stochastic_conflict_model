    "## Overview of the Stochastic Conflict Model <a id=\"overview_A\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we describe the model, as currently envisioned and implemented, but this is still a work in progress.  Referring to the last section, let U denote a geospatial grid of values that quantify unrest.\n",
    "Let C1 denote a geospatial grid of values that quantify the average degree to which people in a given grid cell communicate with people in nearest neighbor (adjacent) grid cells.  Let C2 denote a geospatial grid of values that quantify the average degree to which people in a grid cell communicate with (i.e. send or receive information to/from) people in any other grid cell.  Note:  C2 depends on the degree to which a given cell is connected electronically to the rest of the country (or region or world).  In general, U, C1, and C2 values would be expected to vary both spatially and in time. (These may be estimated by a machine learning algorithm or some other algorithm as functions of selected indicator variables.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  While TVs, radios and newspapers allow people to receive information, they are much less likely to be used by people to send information to others.  This is in sharp contrast with telephones (cell or land-line), and internet access which allow two-way communication.  In order for information to spread from one cell to another, it has to first be received by some means and then sent or forwarded via two-way communication.  Perhaps we should therefore distinguish between the degree to which people in a grid cell receive information electronically (by TV, radio, newspaper, phone, internet), and the degree to which they send it electronically (only by phone & internet).  The time it takes for a person to act on information received (e.g. forward it, organize a protest, write about it) should probably also be taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  We could instead define C1 and C2 as follows.  Let B1 and B2 denote the average degree to which any one person can communicate with (1) people in a nearest neighbor grid cell, or (2) people in any other grid cell in the country, respectively.  We could then compute C1 and C2 by multiplying B1 and B2 by the population count of the grid cell.  This would underscore the fact that -- especially for 2-way communication -- the total amount of communication is proportional to population size, and not simply related to the percentage of the population that can communicate electronically.\n",
    "Conflict Emergence\n",
    "Let E(i,j,k) denote the event that a conflict emerges during the kth discrete time interval, in the grid cell that has column and row indices i and j.   Let p(i,j,k) be the probability of the event E(i,j,k):\n",
    "\n",
    "p(i,j,k) = p_emerge(i,j,k) = Prob[ E(i, j, k)]\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that p(i,j,k) is an increasing function of U(i,j,k). Initially, we will simply consider the special case where p(i,j,k) is proportional to U(i,j,k), so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "if (S(i,j,k) = 0),\t\tp(i,j,k) = c_emerge * U(i,j,k) / max_i,j [ U(i,j,k) ]\n",
    "if (S(i,j,k) = 1),\t\tp(i,j,k) = 0,\n",
    "\n",
    "where c_emerge is in (0,1].  Here, we have normalized the grid U(i,j,k) and then multiplied the result by a constant, c.    Dividing by the array max and multiplying by a model parameter c in (0,1] guarantees that 0 <= p(i,j,k) < 1 for every grid cell --- as it must since it is a probability.  Note that the parameter c can be adjusted to make conflicts more or less likely to occur.  In the special case where all values in the U grid are equal, all cells will have the same probability of conflict emergence: p_emerge = c_emerge.   (Note: Instead of dividing by the array max, we could have divided by the array sum, but then the upper bound on c is more complicated.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let S be a geospatial grid with the same dimensions as U, C1 and C2, such that the value of a grid cell in S is 1 if the cell is experiencing (or engaged in) a conflict, and 0 otherwise.  For each model timestep, and for each grid cell, generate an independent, random variable from a Bernoulli distribution (see Bernoulli Distribution, 2021)  such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "S(i,j,k) = 1 with probability p(i,j,k) and\n",
    "S(i,j,k) = 0 with probability (1 - p(i,j,k)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the E(S(i,j,k) = p(i,j,k) for a Bernoulli random variable.  Also recall that the expected value of a sum of random variables is equal to the sum of their expected values, even if they are not independent.  Therefore, the expected number of grid cells in which a conflict is initiated in the 1st time interval (k=1, before any spreading) is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "   E( Sum_i,j [S(i,j,1)] = ( total conflicts in 1st interval ) = Sum_i,j [p(i,j,1)]\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected number of grid cells in which a conflict is initiated in the kth time interval (k >1, before spreading), will be less than this since cells already experiencing conflict (i.e. with S=1) are excluded (i.e. for them, p(i,j,k) = 0).\n",
    "Conflict Spreading\n",
    "For every grid cell that has S(i,j,k) = 1, the next step is to determine if conflict spreads to other grid cells (which could be nearest neighbors or far away due to electronic connectivity).  If it does, the spreading process is repeated for those other grid cells until there is no further spreading.  (That is, no cells have their S value changed to 1.)  Since there is a lag time between cell-to-cell communication and a resulting action (to spread conflict into a new cell), we introduce a time lag parameter, tau, which can be taken to be a multiple of the model timestep. (In the current version of the model, tau = 1.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 special cases of spreading that can be considered:\n",
    "Case 1:  no spreading,\n",
    "Case 2:  spreading only by local connectivity,\n",
    "Case 3:  spreading by only nonlocal connectivity, and\n",
    "Case 4:  spreading by both local and nonlocal connectivity. \n",
    "For the last three of these cases, various spreading rules are also possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 1.  No spreading.  While there may be conflict in many cells, there is no spreading of conflict to other grid cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 2.  Spreading only by local connectivity.  In this case, conflict can only spread from a grid cell with conflict to other grid cells that have sufficiently high C1 and U values.  Cells with a high C1 value should include nearest neighbor grid cells and possibly other cells, such as those separated by a very short travel time.  In the current version of the model, the probability of spreading to any nearest neighbor is weighted by the U value of that neighbor, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    " \t\t\tp(n) = c_spread * U(n) / max_n(U(n)), \n",
    "\n",
    "where c_spread is in (0,1] and n is a nearest neighbor index.  If U is zero for all neighbors, then p=0.  Notice that conflict cannot spread to a neighbor that has U=0, and this should include grid cells in a lake or in the ocean, for example.  In the current version, conflict cannot “spread to” or “re-emerge” in a cell that already has conflict,  but this could be changed.  Various other spreading rules are also possible, such as:\n",
    " \n",
    "(a) Conflict will spread to any neighbor, n, such that U(n) > U0, where U0 is a threshold value.\n",
    "(b) Conflict will spread to any neighbor, n, such that U(n) >= a * U(i), with a in (0,1].\n",
    "(c)  The probability of spreading to any neighbor is weighted by the U and C1 values of that neighbor, for example using:\n",
    "\n",
    "p(n) = c_spread * [U(n) * C1(n)] / max_n [ U(n) * C1(n) ],\n",
    "\n",
    "where c_spread is in (0,1].  Here, the probability of spreading to a neighbor is low if either U(n) or C1(n) is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 3.  Spreading only by nonlocal connectivity.  In this case conflict can spread from a grid cell with conflict to any other grid cells that have sufficiently high C2 and U values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 4.  Spreading by both local and nonlocal connectivity.  In this case, conflict can spread from a cell with conflict to:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1a) any of its nearest neighbor grid cells if its own C1 value is sufficiently high, and if their value of U is sufficiently high,   OR\n",
    "(1b) any of its nearest neighbor grid cells with sufficiently high C1 and U values.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) any other grid cell with sufficiently high C2 and U values.\n",
    "Conflict Duration\n",
    "For every grid cell that had its S value set to 1 in the kth time interval (by emergence/triggering or spreading), generate an independent random variable from a Bernoulli distribution (Bernoulli Distribution, 2021) with parameter, p_resolve.  If B=1, the conflict is resolved in time interval k and if B=0 the conflict continues.  If we take X to be the random number of time intervals before the conflict is resolved, which is the duration of the conflict, then X will have a Geometric distribution (Geometric Distribution, 2021) with parameter p_resolve.  The expected value of this random duration is then equal to 1/p_resolve. (So a smaller value of p_resolve results in a larger mean duration.)  As long as conflict is active within a cell (some number of timesteps) it will attempt to spread to other cells.\n",
    "Expected Results\n",
    "Depending on the values of the model parameters U, C1, C2, c_emerge, c_spread and p_resolve, this model can exhibit a wide range of behaviors, from rare conflicts that remain isolated to conflicts that spread to fill an entire region.  Preliminary mathematical analysis of this model as well as early simulations suggests that if the model parameters are assumed not to vary with time, then this model may evolve toward a “statistical steady-state” condition where:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) the mean rate at which new conflicts appear (by either emergence or spreading) eventually becomes equal to the mean rate at which they are resolved, and therefore\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) the mean number of grid cells that are experiencing conflict in the kth time interval approaches a constant.\n",
    "\n",

Type <b>conda env list</b> to list your available environments.  You can switch to one of your other environments using the command <b>conda activate envname</b>.  (Replace \"envname\" with the name of an environment.) You can switch back to the base environment with the command <b>conda deactivate</b>.  It is better not to install new packages into the base environment.  See the online conda documentation on [<b>Managing Environments</b>](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for more information.\n",

    "It is always a good idea to update conda itself before creating new environments and installing packages in them. The \"-n\" flag is followed by the name of the environment to update, and the \"-c\" flag is followed by the name of the <b>channel</b> from which to get packages.  A channel is a collection of Python packages that are provided and maintained by some group.  The word \"defaults\" refers to\n",

    "refers to another popular collection and the GitHub organization that maintains it.  Many Python packages are available from both of these channels.  (However, the ipyleaflet and pydap  packages are currently not available in the Anaconda collection.) When you are installing several packages into an environment, the potential for installation problems seems to be less if you get them all from the same channel.  Keep in mind that packages you install will likely depend on many other Python packages, so there is a potential for conflicts, usually related to different package versions.  Using conda environments helps to mitigate against this and helps with <b>reproducibility</b>.\n",

    "Once you've switched to an environment with <b>conda activate envname</b>, you can type <b>conda list</b> to see a list of packages.

The kernel name is displayed in the upper right corner.  Notebooks typically open with the \"environment kernel\" they were created with.
