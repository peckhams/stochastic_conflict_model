    "## Overview of the Stochastic Conflict Model <a id=\"overview_A\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we describe the model, as currently envisioned and implemented, but this is still a work in progress.  Referring to the last section, let U denote a geospatial grid of values that quantify unrest.\n",
    "Let C1 denote a geospatial grid of values that quantify the average degree to which people in a given grid cell communicate with people in nearest neighbor (adjacent) grid cells.  Let C2 denote a geospatial grid of values that quantify the average degree to which people in a grid cell communicate with (i.e. send or receive information to/from) people in any other grid cell.  Note:  C2 depends on the degree to which a given cell is connected electronically to the rest of the country (or region or world).  In general, U, C1, and C2 values would be expected to vary both spatially and in time. (These may be estimated by a machine learning algorithm or some other algorithm as functions of selected indicator variables.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  While TVs, radios and newspapers allow people to receive information, they are much less likely to be used by people to send information to others.  This is in sharp contrast with telephones (cell or land-line), and internet access which allow two-way communication.  In order for information to spread from one cell to another, it has to first be received by some means and then sent or forwarded via two-way communication.  Perhaps we should therefore distinguish between the degree to which people in a grid cell receive information electronically (by TV, radio, newspaper, phone, internet), and the degree to which they send it electronically (only by phone & internet).  The time it takes for a person to act on information received (e.g. forward it, organize a protest, write about it) should probably also be taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  We could instead define C1 and C2 as follows.  Let B1 and B2 denote the average degree to which any one person can communicate with (1) people in a nearest neighbor grid cell, or (2) people in any other grid cell in the country, respectively.  We could then compute C1 and C2 by multiplying B1 and B2 by the population count of the grid cell.  This would underscore the fact that -- especially for 2-way communication -- the total amount of communication is proportional to population size, and not simply related to the percentage of the population that can communicate electronically.\n",
    "Conflict Emergence\n",
    "Let E(i,j,k) denote the event that a conflict emerges during the kth discrete time interval, in the grid cell that has column and row indices i and j.   Let p(i,j,k) be the probability of the event E(i,j,k):\n",

In the special case where all values in the U grid are equal, all cells will have the same probability of conflict emergence: p_emerge = c_emerge.

If we take X to be the random number of time intervals before the conflict is resolved, which is the duration of the conflict, then X will have a Geometric distribution (Geometric Distribution, 2021) with parameter p_resolve.  The expected value of this random duration is then equal to 1/p_resolve. (So a smaller value of p_resolve results in a larger mean duration.)

One feature of conda is support for multiple environments, which are isolated from one another.  When you install Anaconda, an environment called <b>base</b> is created for you and a base set of commonly-used Python packages are installed there.  However, you can (and should!) create additional, named environments and install different sets of Python packages into them without worrying about potential conflicts with packages in other environments.  Type <b>conda env list</b> to list your available environments.  You can switch to one of your other environments using the command <b>conda activate envname</b>.  (Replace \"envname\" with the name of an environment.) You can switch back to the base environment with the command <b>conda deactivate</b>.  It is better not to install new packages into the base environment.

When you are installing several packages into an environment, the potential for installation problems seems to be less if you get them all from the same channel.  Keep in mind that packages you install will likely depend on many other Python packages, so there is a potential for conflicts, usually related to different package versions.  Using conda environments helps to mitigate against this and helps with <b>reproducibility</b>.\n",
